## Xots_Summary
xotsIntro=Xots is designed as an all-encompassing replacement for multi-threaded processing, asynchronous jobs, Java agents and DOTS tasks. It is designed to enable these tasks to be coded within the application and re-use existing logic without needing to duplicate code. The functionality for multi-threaded or asynchronous jobs is fully-functional and production-ready.
xotsIntro2=The Xots service should be started automatically by the platform''s implementation of ODA and you can access it via {0}. From there you can call {1} or {2} to register and trigger a Xots tasklet to the service. See the sub-pages for examples and information about creating the tasklet classes.
xotsArch=Xots Tasklets are Java classes implementing Callable (to wait for a return value) or Runnable (for background tasks). The classes will also need the @Tasklet annotation. The tasklet needs passing to the Xots service, an extension on the AbstractDominoExecutor class. That class wraps the tasklet, as either a XotsWrappedCallable or XotsWrappedRunnable. Those wrappers create the relevant Session (and in the future will possibly do more) and allow a single method to process the tasklet.
xotsLimit=<ul><li>Scheduler is not yet implemented</li><li>TRUSTED session type is not yet implemented</li><li>The {0} method doesn''t work. Use {1} instead.</li><li>XPages scoped variables / application-specific objects will be passed into the Xots class via the {2} if you extend the relevant Xsp interface. See examples for more details.</li></ul>
## Xots Trasklet
taskletRules=A Xots Tasklet must follow a few standard rules:<ul><li>It must implement either the {0} or {1} interface (use {2} or {3} for XPages).</li><li>The class must be annotated by the {4} annotation</li><li>The annotation should define the {5} variable as one of the {6} enum options</li>
taskletContext=An {0} object is passed into the tasklet. This contains three properties:<ul><li>{1} - the context path for the application, for use in OpenLog logging</li><li>{2} - path for OpenLog logging database to log to</li><li>{3} - name of this class, used for logging</li></ul>
taskletXspContext=If extending the XPages interfaces, an {0} object is passed, which has six additional properties:<ul><li>The four scopes ({1}). <b>NOTE:</b> writing to the first two is not recommended.</li><li>{2}</li><li>{3}</li></ul>
taskletRun=If a Xots Tasklet implements {0} the tasklet will run in the background and the code will continue. If a Xots Tasklet implements {1} the tasklet returns a value and the code can wait for and process the response.
