## getEntries
getSummary=Getting entries / documents in the core API can be convoluted, depends on out-of-date constructs, demands looping that is unconventional for Java development, has some gotchas, and requires careful use of the {0} method. The various methods in ODA are designed to alleviate these issues. {1} and {2} take an object (String, List etc) and default to exact match only (the typical requirement). Their collections are iterable, so a standard Java {3} loop can be used. As with everything else, the Cpp handles are autoamtically recycled. With the ''khan'' xsp.property or the {4} fix, updates to the view during processing are ignored. With the same xsp.property or the {5} fix, all columns in the view's design are returned (by default columns with constant values are ignored).<br/>
getFirst=Developers used to the core API will be used to using {0} and {1}. For consistency and standardisation these methods are marked deprecate in favour of {2} and {3}. However, there is no intention to remove the traditional methods.
